Mileage Prediction

The objective of this project is to develop a linear regression model to predict vehicle mileage ('mpg') based on four key features: 'displacement', 'horsepower', 'weight', and 'acceleration'.
Model Type:Linear Regression
Features Used:
  - Displacement:Engine size in cubic inches.
  - Horsepower:Engine power output.
  - Weight:Vehicle weight.
  - Acceleration:Time to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph.

The model quantifies how each feature affects mileage. For instance, increase in displacement, horsepower, weight, and acceleration are associated with decreased mileage.
The model was trained on historical data and evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
